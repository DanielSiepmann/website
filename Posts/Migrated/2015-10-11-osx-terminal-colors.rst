OS X Terminal colors and fonts
==============================

If you're using the OS X build in terminal, you wanna change the colors.  The default colors aren't
that nice. Instead of changing them manually and figure out a nice set of colors, just grab an
existing color scheme for the app. Here are some links with nice color schemes ready to use for you.

|OS X Terminal Settings|

To change colors open the settings of terminal app and go to *Profiles*.  Right there you already
can select one of the delivered profiles. Double click to open a new instance with this profile and
get a look at it. If you are happy with your choice, you can set it as default in the bottom of the
list.

To add a new profile click the ``+`` in the bottom and modify the settings. You can also import a
file with ``terminal`` suffix.

`Smyck <http://color.smyck.org/>`__ is available for more programs like Vim and Sublime Text. It
comes with a ``terminal`` file ready to import.  |Smyck|

If you like to have more options, take a look at `base16 <http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/>`__
where you have 36 different ones. In his `repository <https://github.com/chriskempson/base16>`__ are
links to further resources you wanna check out. |base16| Duplicate an existing scheme in the
terminal app and modify the files. Copy the hex values of each color and paste them in the copied
scheme.

Perhaps you also wanna change the font of your terminal. That's also possible in the so called
*profile*. Just to get an idea of the different fonts others use, check out one of the following
comparisons.
