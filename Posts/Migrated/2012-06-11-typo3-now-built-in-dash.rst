TYPO3 now built in Dash
=======================

The documentation Team (`Fabien Udriot <http://forge.typo3.org/users/1741>`__) and the developer of
`Dash <https://kapeli.com/dash>`__ (Bogdan) have worked on `the issue
<http://forge.typo3.org/issues/37427>`__ integrating TYPO3 into Dash. Now the new version of Dash
comes with TYPO3 API built in.

You don't have to do anything to add the TYPO3 4.7 API to Dash.
