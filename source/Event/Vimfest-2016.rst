Vimfest Berlin 2016
===================

You can find the Event online at http://vimfest.de/ .

Following the agenda, I'll list the different things like Hacking, Talks and Tools in different
sections here, so you can get an insight how the event was for me, what was shared and what I wanted
to do.

Hacking
-------

The things I wanted to do during the hacking at first day:

* Provide presentation configuration for Vim / Terminal.

* Try out `Athame`_ an extension for zsh and readline to pipe keystrokes through an actual Vim
  process to not have an reduced emulation but the full power of Vim.

* Try out `mycli`_ an interactive MySQL shell client with syntax highlighting and auto completion.

* Try out `PHP Refactoring support for Vim`_, support like PHPStorm and other IDEs provide to
  extract code into a new method or rename variables, clean up use statements, ... .

* Try out `tldr`_ an CLI client to user contributed simplified man pages.

* Read `Awesome lists`_ to check out nice findings.

* Try out `vim gutentags`_.

* Taskwarrior
  `Taskwarrior Cheat sheet <http://lintut.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/taskwarrior-1024x819.png>`_

* Finish first working version of `Codemonitoring`_.

Talks
-----

The things I wanted to to during the talks at second day:

* Present my own two talks:

  * :ref:`introduction-to-git-for-daily-usage`
  * :ref:`my-vim-setup`
