Crypt Mails and Chats on Mac OS X
=================================

You can crypt your Mail and Chat on Mac easily using `Adium <https://adium.im/>`__ and Apple Mail
using `GPG <https://gpgtools.org/>`__. Here you can find the manuals:

-  Mail:
   https://support.gpgtools.org/kb/how-to/first-steps-where-do-i-start-where-do-i-begin
-  Adium: http://securityspread.com/2013/07/09/encrypted-chats-adium/

Some more information about OTR (Off-the-record) Chat can be found on `cypherpunks.ca
<https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/>`__ and implementation for clients.

How can you check that everything is crypted?

- Mail: Open the mail with a different client. You will see the crypted message instead the
  content.
- Chat: E.g. for GTalk open the browser and see the crypted messages after sending it via Adium.
