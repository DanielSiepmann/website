Link list for Vim
=================

As a dedicated Vim user I've collected some links already which I want to share as a list here. This
list is dedicated to my team mate `@dk2kde <https://twitter.com/dk2kde>`_. And I recommend walking
through them in the order I've listed them.

1. `Vimtutor <http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_01.html#tutor>`__
   Interactive tutorial inside Vim to get you started.
2. `Vim Help <http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/>`__
   The internal Vim help, also available off line in your Vim via
   ``:help``. It's a good idea to read it once. At least the TOC to know
   what's there to check it out as soon as you need it.
3. `Book Practical
   Vim <https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim>`__
   I definitely recommend reading this book as it walks you through most
   use cases without being bloated. Even if you just think about
   switching to Vim, get this book and look up if it's worth to switch.
4. `VimAwesome <http://vimawesome.com/>`__
   A collection of Vim plugins with grouping by topics and search. Of
   course you can train the shortcuts on the page by using ``J`` an
   ``K`` and such.
   If you are looking for a feature that vim doesn't offer, just search
   there.
   Tip: If you enter the page, plugins are sorted by popularity, so you
   wanna check out the top most plugins to get an idea what plugins can
   do for you.
5. `Vim Text Objects: The Definitive
   Guide <http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/>`__
   Introduction into textobjects which are one of the defacto reasons to
   use Vim over other editors.
6. `Vimcasts <http://vimcasts.org/episodes/>`__
   Very short screencasts for Vim, each dedicated to one small topic. So
   you can check out what you need, and learn one by one.
7. `Learn Vimscript the Hard
   Way <http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/>`__
   If you want a guided tour follow this one. It's a nice addition, and
   free in the www. In my opinion it's not as easy for beginners as the
   book above. But to get even deeper, it's the next level after the
   book. It also covers some more topics then the book does.
8. ``dotfiles`` Repositories by other users.
   As most users recommend, so do I. Read public so called ``.dotfiles``
   repositories on e.g. `github <https://github.com>`__. Just use this
   search: https://github.com/search?q=.dotfiles&ref=opensearch

The following links are from my bookmarks and I can't remember them, so the list is unordered and
you have to take a look whether they are great or not. And of course I can't describe them.

-  `Vim Videos by Derek Wyatt <http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/>`__
-  `Vimscript
   handbooks <https://bitbucket.org/ajabutex/vimscript-handbooks>`__

Last but not least, practice and adjust, google if you need and read blog posts like the following.

-  `How I boosted my
   Vim <http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/>`__
-  `Using Vim as a PHP
   IDE <http://blog.joncairns.com/2012/05/using-vim-as-a-php-ide/>`__
-  `How to boost your Vim
   productivity <https://sheerun.net/2014/03/21/how-to-boost-your-vim-productivity/>`__

And of course a good cheatsheet will help you all the time. |Vim cheat

[UPDATE]

There are also some *videos* which you should check out. I've added all videos to a `playlist
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDXiDr43HScG8TQ6L6YPTK13ATFc2b8ke>`__, so you can `check
them out <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDXiDr43HScG8TQ6L6YPTK13ATFc2b8ke>`__ and I'll add
further while watching. But there is another `playlist
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8tzorAO7s0jy7DQ3Q0FwF3BnXGQnDirs>`__ by `thoughtbot
<https://thoughtbot.com/>`__ conainting a lot of vim meetups

If you know more resources that should be mentioned here, just contact with me by one of the ways
