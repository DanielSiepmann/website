TYPO3 now built in Dash
=======================

The documentation Team (:t3issue:`Fabien Udriot <1741>`) and the developer of `Dash
<https://kapeli.com/dash>`__ (Bogdan) have worked on :t3issue:`the issue <37427>` integrating TYPO3
into Dash. Now the new version of Dash comes with TYPO3 API built in.

You don't have to do anything to add the TYPO3 4.7 API to Dash.
