Concepts
========

I've written some concepts in the past. In this Blog post you find a list of the currently published
concepts (updated automatically) and also the reason why I've written those concepts. Concepts are
most likely about specific software but might also be about other things like project management.
The concepts will grow, hopefully, in the future, depending on time and motivation. As I hate
promises that are not met, this is no promise.

Why

Why did I wrote the listed concepts?

List of published concepts

Concepts of the future

Once one of the above ideas, or any other, is finished, I'll create a new Blog post and update this
post.

Further reading

You can check out the current state of concepts at :ref:`concepts`.

Also you can take a look at the current state of the projects mentioned above at:

- https://codemonitoring.readthedocs.io/en/feature-first-import-mechanism/

- https://atomickittenframework.readthedocs.io/en/master/

Also the following books are a good read:

- `Spirit of Kaizen: Creating Lasting Excellence One Small Step at a Time
  <https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0071796177/>`_,

- `One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way
  <https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0761129235/>`_,

They are nearly the same, so it should be enough to buy one of them.
