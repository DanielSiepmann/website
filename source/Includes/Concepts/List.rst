The future of TYPO3 CMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Was written back in the end of 2014 after TYPO3 Camp Rhein Ruhr.

Mathias Schreiber had a talk about the idea of Apps in `TYPO3 CMS`_. After some discussions I've
written this concept with some talks to Mathias.  It might be out of date in some places, but still
has some ideas others can adopt. Nothing is really new, but some concepts used by other products are
put together, to form a new user experience for CMS.

Concept available at :ref:`The future of TYPO3 CMS <concept-typo3-cms:about>`.
