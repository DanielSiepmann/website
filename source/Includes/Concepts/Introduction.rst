I like to create new ideas and concepts. There are so many software products out there, but most of
them are not satisfiable. The ideas behind them are nice and the problems they try to solve still
exist. Most software is in use, because there is no better alternative.

To overcome this issue, I try to write concepts once in a while. They will be listed here as a
central place. If there is something interesting to you, just contact me. All Concepts are released
under GNU GPL 2+. Also each concept is just a sphinx project with rst files versioned with git. So
you can easily get access and generate further formats and go further.
