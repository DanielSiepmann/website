Vim PHPStorm Stubs
==================

About
-----

`PHPStorm`_ manages an official `Github repository with PHP Stubs`_ providing necessary PHPDoc. As the
stubs are valid PHP, we can use them to build a :file:`tags` file which integrated into VIM. By
doing so we can navigate to all PHP functions as tags to bring up the offline documentation.

Usage
-----

After installation just go to tag as you would normally do. Also you might find it more helpfull to
use the preview behaviour of vim: `CTRL-W }`_.
