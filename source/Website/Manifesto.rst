Explanations
============

Mot of the things mentioned here are about loving what you do, because if you do something you don't
love, then it will never satisfy you.

Even if a fast Implementation is cheaper, that's only true for a very short time. It's always more
expensive then a clean working solution.
You always need to adjust your solution at some time, which will be cheaper if your existing
solution was well designed.

If you are doing something, do it the right way, there is no other way that will satisfy. Why would
you do something the half way or just try something?

If you don't already know the right way, invest some time to find the right way. Build prototypes
and investigate. Otherwise you will produce a half way working solution with shortcomings.

Participate in any way. Share your knowledge, improve existing code or documentation. If you are
using an open source product, help improving it by filling our bug reports or feature requests.
Create pull requests and improve documentation. Also go to events like code sprints or user groups
and meetups. Share your knowledge and get new insights.

Knowledge is power, you will be able to solve more tasks in shorter time, support others in solving
issues and just be better. Invest by the above ideas like meetups and such, also follow blogs and
read books. Read about new concept and ideas and understand the technologies you use.

You often have discussions with product owner or project manager about the product. Most of the time
they will produce more work. It's more important to have a working product that will help your
customer, then investing more and more time in discussions.
