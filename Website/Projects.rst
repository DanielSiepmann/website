Projects
========

This is a list of all my own projects I've started. Most of them are dead today as I use projects
to try out new things and understand them.

The list is not finished yet, but I think I'll add further projects one by one over time.

Profiles
--------

This is a list of websites where I've a project and my projects can be found:

* My `Github <https://github.com/DanielSiepmann/>`_ Profile and a list of my `Repositories <https://github.com/DanielSiepmann?tab=repositories>`_.
* My :ref:`Docker` `profile <https://hub.docker.com/r/danielsiepmann/>`_ where my published docker
  containers can be found.

.. _projects-active:

Current active projects
-----------------------

A list of projects I'm currently working on, more or less active:

* Docker

  * :ref:`t3-sphinx`

* Sphinx

  * :ref:`This website <sphinx-website>`

.. _sphinx-website:

Sphinx
^^^^^^

This website. A try to move all my knowledge in plain text over to ``rst`` and render it with
*Sphinx*. Also migrated my whole Blog from *Jekyll* over to sphinx.

.. _t3-sphinx:

t3-sphinx
^^^^^^^^^

`Public Github Repository <https://github.com/DanielSiepmann/t3-sphinx>`_ Docker container to ease
writing documentation for TYPO3. Contains a full set up Sphinx setup to generate the
documentation.

.. _projects-inactive:

Old inactive projects
---------------------

This projects are no longer interesting. But are kept as you never know when you need them again,
e.g. to take a look how you solved something earlier.

Jenkins
^^^^^^^
First steps with Docker where I learned that you should better use :command:`docker compose`
instead of providing all software in one docker image.
